## Problem
Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic and hereditary skin condition that causes inflammation, leading to the appearance of lesions and intense itching. It is not contagious, and its exact cause is unknown. Three out of ten Brazilians believe that atopic dermatitis, characterized by dry skin, red lesions, and intense itching, is a contagious health problem, implying that it can be transmitted through direct contact. This misconception indicates prejudice towards this condition, affecting 15% to 25% of children and approximately 7% of adults. This conclusion arises from a research study released on Thursday (23) by the Brazilian Society of Dermatology (SBD). The study was conducted by the Datafolha Institute, with institutional support from the bio-pharmaceutical company AbbVie.

## Objective
Our goal with this project is to raise awareness and assist individuals living in peripheral areas (where overall healthcare services are scarce) in conducting their necessary consultations online. The three essential requirements are a mobile phone, internet access, and registration in our system. After the client reports the problem, a preliminary test for the occurrence of the disease will be conducted. Our AI will analyze a photo provided by the client and provide a prognosis. This enables the client and the hospital to take the necessary treatment and prevention measures.

## Description
Our TrataDerma project will operate simply, quickly, and effectively, building on the foundation of the "Development and Validation of Computational Diagnostic Strategies for COVID-19 Using Conventional Radiology and Computed Tomography Images" project (click the link for more information). This project utilizes computational technology to assist doctors in diagnosing respiratory diseases. Initially designed during the 2020 pandemic to facilitate Covid diagnosis, it expanded to include other respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, viral, and bacterial pneumonia. Competitive advantages include a higher availability of services compared to other competitors (as the system operates 24/7), increased diagnostic precision for the attending physician, assistance in relieving hospital queues, and more. It's important to note that this system provides prognoses rather than diagnoses. In medicine, this refers to advanced knowledge or judgment made by a doctor, in this case, carried out by the AI instead of a physician, similar to our project.
